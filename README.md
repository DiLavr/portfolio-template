Picture-in-Picture Chrome browser API is a JavaScript-based interface for Chrome that allows users to view multiple websites side-by-side in a compact and effective manner. It provides developers with an intuitive and straightforward way to integrate a picture-in-picture mode, breaking down barriers between users and their desired content.

The JavaScript-based API creates an efficient environment by requiring minimal code compared to other solutions like HTML Canvas or JavaScript elements. This enables developers to benefit from optimized performance while utilizing modern technologies, delivering a visually appealing experience for users.
