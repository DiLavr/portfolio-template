          Picture-in-Picture Chrome browser API is a JavaScript-based interface
          for Chrome that allows users to view multiple websites side-by-side in
          a compact and effective manner. It provides developers with an
          intuitive and straightforward way to integrate a picture-in-picture
          mode, breaking down barriers between users and their desired content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The JavaScript-based API creates an efficient environment by requiring
          minimal code compared to other solutions like HTML Canvas or
          JavaScript elements. This enables developers to benefit from optimized
          performance while utilizing modern technologies, delivering a visually
          appealing experience for users.

          This script allows you to capture a window or Chrome browser tab and
          stream it in Picture-in-Picture mode. It works only in Chrome-based
          browsers.

          Pick the source in the pop-up window and click "Start". You'll see the
          Picture-in-Picture sharing screen in the corner of your screen.

          To utilize the API, developers can leverage the provided code snippet.
          The code utilizes the navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()
          function to prompt the user to select a media stream, which typically
          represents a screen or application window. The selected media stream
          is then assigned to a video element (videoElement) on the page,
          allowing the user to see the chosen content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the media stream is assigned, the code sets up an event listener
          (videoElement.onloadedmetadata) to ensure that the video is loaded and
          ready to play. When the metadata is loaded, the video starts playing
          automatically, providing an uninterrupted viewing experience for the
          user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the code includes functionality to enable
          picture-in-picture mode upon clicking a button (button). When the
          button is clicked, it triggers the
          videoElement.requestPictureInPicture() function, which requests the
          browser to enter picture-in-picture mode with the selected video. This
          allows the video to be displayed in a floating window overlaying other
          content on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enhance user experience, the code also disables the button during
          the picture-in-picture transition to prevent multiple requests and
          potential conflicts. Once the picture-in-picture mode is activated,
          the button is re-enabled, allowing the user to control and exit the
          picture-in-picture view as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon loading the page, the selectMediaStream() function is called,
          initiating the prompt for the user to select the media source. This
          ensures that the picture-in-picture functionality is readily available
          and provides a seamless transition from single-window browsing to a
          multitasking environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, this small project showcases the power of JavaScript and
          the Picture-in-Picture Chrome Browser API to integrate a
          picture-in-picture mode into the Chrome browser. It offers developers
          an efficient and straightforward solution for enhancing the browsing
          experience, while allowing users to conveniently view multiple
          websites simultaneously. The provided code demonstrates how to prompt
          the user for a media stream, enable picture-in-picture mode, and
          ensure smooth video playback.
